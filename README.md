## Dataset

#### Provided Data

There are 8 weather datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. These correponds to rainfall, sunshine, humidity, and temperature information. 

* [`rainfall-monthly-highest-daily-total.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-highest-daily-total.csv): Monthly highest total daily rainfall from 1982 to 2022, measured in milimeters(mm).
* [`rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-number-of-rain-days.csv): Monthly number of rain days from 1982 to 2022. A day is considered to have “rained” if the total rainfall for that day is 0.2mm or more.
* [`rainfall-monthly-total.csv`](./data/rainfall-monthly-total.csv): Monthly total rain recorded in mm(millimeters) from 1982 to 2022.
* [`sunshine-duration-monthly-mean-daily-duration`](./data/sunshine-duration-monthly-mean-daily-duration.csv): Mean sunshine hours per month from 1982 to 2022, measured in hours (hrs).
* [`relative-humidity-monthly-mean`](./data/relative-humidity-monthly-mean.csv): Mean relative humidity per month from 1982 to 2022, measured in percentage(%).
* [`surface-air-temperature-annual-mean-daily-minimum`](./data/surface-air-temperature-annual-mean-daily-minimum.csv): Mean daily minimum surface air temperature per year from 1982 to 2022, measure in degrees Celsius(°C).
* [`surface-air-temperature-monthly-mean-daily-minimum`](./data/surface-air-temperature-monthly-mean-daily-minimum.csv): Mean daily minimum surface air temperature per month from 1982 to 2022, measure in degrees Celsius(°C).
* [`wet-bulb-temperature-hourly.csv`](./data/wet-bulb-temperature-hourly.csv): Hourly wet bulb temperature in degrees Celcius(°C) at 100% relative humidity.
