## Background & External Research

Introduction <br>

Dengue virus is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos. Dengue can range from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe disease. An estimated 1 in 4 dengue virus infections are symptomatic. Symptomatic dengue virus infection most commonly presents as a mild to moderate, nonspecific, acute febrile illness. Approximately 1 in 20 patients with dengue virus disease progress to develop severe, life-threatening disease called severe dengue. The second infection with DENV is a risk factor for severe dengue. Severe dengue can be life-threatening within a few hours and often requires care at a hospital.

Singapore launched a comprehensive nationwide programme in 1968 targeting the Aedes mosquito, the main mosquito vector of dengue. This control programme combines environmental management, source reduction, public health education and law enforcement. Since then, the number of homes found to be breeding Aedes mosquito fell sharply and remains low.

However, Dengue remains endemic in Singapore. Since the 1990s, there have been periodic spikes in cases occurring in five- to six-year cycles. The spike in 2019 and 2020 could be a case in point, coming after the epidemics in 2013 and 2014, which saw over 22,000 and 18,000 cases respectively. 

Several theories have been proposed to explain this cyclical pattern. <br> 
> 1. The dengue virus has four different serotypes, and a switch in the predominant virus serotype has been a historical precursor of dengue epidemics in Singapore. For example, two large epidemics, each stretching over two years in 2004–2005 and 2013–2014, were associated with a switch in the main dengue virus serotype from serotype 2 to serotype 1.
> 2. Dengue in Singapore typically rises in warmer months, from April, peaking in July or August, before declining in September or October. Abnormal climate changes, such as the El Niño weather phenomenon, may affect the mosquito breeding environment, accelerate the life-cycle of Aedes mosquito, shorten the incubation period of the dengue virus and drive up cases. El Nino, a recurring weather pattern related to the warming of surface waters in the Pacific Ocean, last occurred in 2015–2016. It is slated to resume in 2023. 
> 3. Population factors also contribute to this endemic. The decrease in dengue transmission due to the successful implementation of the Aedes control programme in the 1970s and 1980s reduced incidence of dengue infection in the population. As herd immunity to dengue is consequently low, a large proportion of the Singapore resident population today remains susceptible to infection by any of the four dengue serotypes.

## Problem Statement

Problem Statement <br>

Given infection and serology, climate, geospatial, and google trends data, you have been tasked to predict the national-level dengue cases 2 weeks into the future. A more accurate method of predicting outbreaks of Dengue virus in mosquitos will help MOH plan when and where to allocate resources for dengue control more effectively. If cases are expected to rise sharply, there is a need to plan for more intensive control and enforcement measures to reduce mosquito breeding and consequentially dengue cases. Also quantify the costs and benefits of such control measures.
